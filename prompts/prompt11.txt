Go to the data folder. For each file in it, read the source code and generate a brief report that describes the programming language used, the purpose of the code (e.g., printing a message, defining a function, etc.), and any notable features (like loops, conditionals, imports). Save each report as a .txt file with the same name (but .txt extension) in a new folder called reports.
